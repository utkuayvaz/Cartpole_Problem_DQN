This is a simple description of each code:

Set_Up.py is used to implement the settings of the cartpole(Do not change)

Q-Learning(RNN).py is where the model is trained and save in the file model.h5
(I already put the model in the current folder, so you won't have to retrain it)

Test.py is where the model is tested from the "Starting position", which can be decided by the user(Line 33-36)

Simulation(Cart-Pole) is where the simulation viedo of the states.npx is made.
To simulate from a different state first run Test.py as the wished state and then run the Simulation(Cart-Pole) script.
